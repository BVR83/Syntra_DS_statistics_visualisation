# Syntra_DS_statistics_visualisation
My repository for the assigment of statistics and visualisation with Pandas and Matplolib.
This repository is created as part of the Syntra Data science course 2024 given by Tim Hellemans

## Created notebooks
This assignment consisted of 2 parts. For both parts, I created a notebook in the scripts folder.

Part 1: Car production -> scripts/notebooks/carproduction.ipynb
Part 2: Production process -> scripts/notebooks/productionprocess.ipynb


## NOTES
Both notebooks contain markdown cells with the questions and I a corresponding markdown cell with a darker background color that contains the answer to the question. 
The code cells below 
All functions contain a docstring.
The repository contains a .yaml file which specifies the python environment used while creating these functions.\
**IMPORTANT!** all notebooks uses packages so please run the code cells on top the notebook that import the packages first.


**Have fun exploring my python statistics and visualisation assignment !!!**

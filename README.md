# Syntra_DS_statistics_visualisation
This is my repository for the assigment of statistics and visualisation with Pandas and Matplolib.<br>
This repository is created as part of the Syntra Data science course 2024 given by Tim Hellemans

## Created notebooks
This assignment consisted of 2 parts.<br> You can find the assignment in the /documentation folder. <br>For both parts, I created a notebook in the /scripts/notebooks folder and a standard plot setup file in the scripts/py folder.
<br>
 <br>Part 1: Car production -> scripts/notebooks/carproduction.ipynb
 <br>Part 2: Production process -> scripts/notebooks/productionprocess.ipynb


## NOTES
Both notebooks contain markdown cells with the questions and a corresponding markdown cell with a darker background color with the answer.
The code cells are always below the answer.
All functions contain a docstring.<br>
<br>The repository contains a .yaml file which specifies the python environment used while creating these functions.\
**IMPORTANT!** all notebooks uses packages so please run the code cells on top the notebook that import the packages first.


**Have fun exploring my python statistics and visualisation assignment !!!**
